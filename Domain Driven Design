i build a API in spring boot in following design, please correct if design is not good

1) Service Name A - Its a gateway to Client Request, Expose HTTP port for client communication
2) Service Name B - Functional Service - Its doing Client Req Validation and Enrichment
3) Service Name C - Its doing Orchestration service, to connect Service D/E based on input to get transaction details and prepare the response message send to Service A for client response
4) Service Name D - Used to connect mastercard API to get the transaction details
5) Service Name E - Connect Visa to get the transaction details


A is connecting to B via Solace
B is connecting to V via Solace
C is connecting to D/E via Solace
D/E is connecting to C via Solace
C is reply the final response to Service A via solace (Reply patter)
A will provide the HTTP response to client




Pros:
Loose Coupling:

Services communicate asynchronously using Solace, reducing dependencies.
Scalability:

Each service can scale independently based on load.
Resilience & Fault Tolerance:

If a downstream service (D/E) fails, retry logic in C can prevent full system failure.
Event-Driven Architecture:

Solace messaging ensures efficient handling of high-volume transactions.
Service Specialization:

Each service has a clear role, making the system maintainable.


Cons / Potential Issues:
Latency Overhead:

Solace messaging adds extra hops compared to direct HTTP calls.
Complex Debugging & Observability:

Harder to trace transactions end-to-end without strong logging and monitoring.
Error Handling Complexity:

Need robust retry and dead-letter queues for message failures.
Backpressure & Message Ordering:

Handling high message throughput in C (orchestration) can be challenging.
High Dependency on Solace:

Any Solace downtime will impact communication between services.






Suggested Improvements

Introduce Circuit Breakers & Retries:
Use Resilience4j in Spring Boot for handling failures in C (especially when calling D/E) and D/E.

Implement Distributed Tracing:
Use OpenTelemetry or Spring Cloud Sleuth with Kibana/Jaeger for tracing messages across services.
Optimize Message Processing in Service C:

Consider parallel processing if C is handling a large volume of requests.
Use Dead Letter Queues (DLQ):

If D/E fails frequently, use a DLQ in Solace to prevent message loss.
