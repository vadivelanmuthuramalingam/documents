Is Redis Hash (like HSET Grace:VCA txnId json) Suitable?
‚úÖ Works Well for:
Grouping related data under one logical namespace (i.e., Grace:VCA)

Quick read/write by field (O(1) complexity)

Memory-efficient for small hash maps (few thousand fields)

‚ùå Major Limitations for Your Case:
Storing 10M fields under one key (Grace:VCA) is not scalable:

Redis hashes are stored in RAM. Huge hash keys increase memory fragmentation, reclaim delays, and bloat snapshot files (RDB/AOF).

You can't evict or expire individual fields easily (unless you build custom logic).

Backup/restore performance will degrade severely.

Redis doesn‚Äôt support setting TTLs for individual hash fields ‚Äî only the entire hash key.

üí° Better Structure for 10M/day
‚úÖ Recommended: One Redis key per transaction
Key: Grace:VCA:<TransactionID>

Value: Transaction JSON

Set:

java
Copy
Edit
redisTemplate.opsForValue().set("Grace:VCA:" + txnId, jsonString);
Get:

java
Copy
Edit
redisTemplate.opsForValue().get("Grace:VCA:" + txnId);



Update (just use .set() again):

java
Copy
Edit
redisTemplate.opsForValue().set("Grace:VCA:" + txnId, updatedJson);
Delete:

java
Copy
Edit
redisTemplate.delete("Grace:VCA:" + txnId);
üîí Add TTL (Optional for Auto-Expiry)
If each transaction is needed only for a limited time:

java
Copy
Edit
redisTemplate.opsForValue().set("Grace:VCA:" + txnId, jsonString, Duration.ofDays(1));
üìä Summary: One Key per Transaction is the Way to Go

Feature	Redis Hash (Grace:VCA)	One Key per Transaction (Grace:VCA:<txnId>)
10M fields support	‚ùå Poor performance, high memory	‚úÖ Scales easily
TTL per transaction	‚ùå Not supported	‚úÖ Yes
Field-level access	‚úÖ Fast, HGET	‚úÖ Also fast, GET
Backup/Restore impact	‚ùå Slow & bloated	‚úÖ Fast & isolated
Update flexibility	‚úÖ via HSET	‚úÖ via SET
Delete specific transaction	‚úÖ via HDEL	‚úÖ via DEL
‚úÖ Verdict:
For 10M+ transactions per day, use:

ini
Copy
Edit
Key   = Grace:VCA:<TransactionID>
Value = JSON string
It‚Äôs clean, highly scalable, and gives you TTL + easier operational management.

üìä Feature Comparison

Feature	Redis String	Redis Hash
Granularity	1 key per record	1 key per batch (e.g., per day)
Memory Efficiency	Less efficient for many keys	More efficient; less overhead per record
Ease of Access (by ID)	Easy with known key	Requires key + field
Bulk Read (All records)	Needs SCAN and filter by prefix	Single call: HGETALL or HSCAN
Field Update	Replace whole value	Can update a single field in hash
Key Expiry	Per key	Expiry per hash key only (whole batch)
Cluster Scaling	Better (spreads across cluster keys)	May create hotspots (all fields under 1 key)
TTL Management	Fine-grained control per key	Coarse-grained (per hash key)
Max Size Limitation	Redis keyspace handles billions	Each hash key can grow large (watch size)
Indexing/Searching	Needs external index/search	Same, not natively supported
‚úÖ Pros and Cons Summary
‚úÖ Redis String

Pros	Cons
Simple to use	Each key has overhead (memory)
Easy to manage TTL per record	Harder to fetch all records by prefix
Distributes well in cluster mode	SCAN is needed for prefix searches
Ideal for large records	Write amplification if value is large
‚úÖ Redis Hash

Pros	Cons
Memory efficient for many small records	TTL is for the whole hash, not individual items
Good for grouping data (e.g., daily)	Single hash key can become a memory hotspot
Easier batch access (HGETALL, HSCAN)	Slightly more complex access patterns
Easy field-level update	Not suited for giant individual objects
üß† When to Use What?

Scenario	Recommended Type
Storing < 1M records per day, individual TTL	String
Storing grouped data by day (e.g., logs, events)	Hash
High frequency updates on fields	Hash
Need to expire each record individually	String
Working with large values (> 1MB per entry)	String
Redis Cluster with auto sharding	String
Optimizing memory usage with small fields	Hash
üöÄ Hybrid Strategy (Best of Both)
You could also combine both:

Use Hash for high-volume, short-lived cache (e.g., Grace:VCA:<yyyy-MM-dd>).

Use String for frequently accessed or long-living transactions (e.g., failed or flagged ones).

Would you like a code sample that uses both with fallback logic?
