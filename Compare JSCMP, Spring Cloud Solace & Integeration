Usage:

Use @Input and @Output annotations or functional programming model (Supplier, Function, Consumer) to send/receive messages.



2. Solace Java API (JCSMP)
Description: Solace provides a native Java API called JCSMP (Java Client for Solace Messaging Protocol) for connecting to Solace brokers.

Key Features:

Full control over Solace features (e.g., direct messaging, guaranteed messaging, transactions).

Suitable for advanced use cases.

Dependencies:
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.solacesystems</groupId>
    <artifactId>sol-jcsmp</artifactId>
    <version>10.19.0</version> <!-- Use the latest version -->
</dependency>


Configuration
import com.solacesystems.jcsmp.*;

JCSMPProperties properties = new JCSMPProperties();
properties.setProperty(JCSMPProperties.HOST, "tcp://<solace-host>:<port>");
properties.setProperty(JCSMPProperties.VPN_NAME, "<vpn-name>");
properties.setProperty(JCSMPProperties.USERNAME, "<username>");
properties.setProperty(JCSMPProperties.PASSWORD, "<password>");

JCSMPSession session = JCSMPFactory.onlyInstance().createSession(properties);
session.connect();


Usage:

Use XMLMessageProducer and XMLMessageConsumer to send and receive messages.

Example:
Topic topic = JCSMPFactory.onlyInstance().createTopic("my-topic");
TextMessage message = JCSMPFactory.onlyInstance().createMessage(TextMessage.class);
message.setText("Hello, Solace!");
producer.send(message, topic);

3. Spring JMS with Solace JMS
Description: Solace provides a JMS (Java Message Service) API that can be used with Spring JMS for messaging.

Key Features:

Works well with Spring's JmsTemplate and @JmsListener.

Dependencies:
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.solacesystems</groupId>
    <artifactId>sol-jms</artifactId>
    <version>10.19.0</version> <!-- Use the latest version -->
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-artemis</artifactId> <!-- or spring-boot-starter-jms -->
</dependency>

Configuration
@Bean
public ConnectionFactory connectionFactory() {
    SolConnectionFactory connectionFactory = SolJmsUtility.createConnectionFactory();
    connectionFactory.setHost("tcp://<solace-host>:<port>");
    connectionFactory.setVPN("<vpn-name>");
    connectionFactory.setUsername("<username>");
    connectionFactory.setPassword("<password>");
    return connectionFactory;
}

@Bean
public JmsTemplate jmsTemplate(ConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {
    return new JmsTemplate(connectionFactory);
}

Usage:

Use JmsTemplate to send messages.

Use @JmsListener to receive messages.


4. Spring Integration with Solace
Description: Spring Integration provides a lightweight messaging framework that can be integrated with Solace using adapters.

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.solacesystems</groupId>
    <artifactId>sol-jcsmp</artifactId>
    <version>10.19.0</version>
</dependency>

Configuration:

Define channels, adapters, and gateways to connect to Solace.

Comparison of Options:
Option	Ease of Use	Flexibility	Use Case
Spring Cloud Stream	High	Medium	Event-driven microservices
Solace Java API (JCSMP)	Medium	High	Advanced messaging features
Spring JMS with Solace JMS	Medium	Medium	Standard JMS-based applications
Spring Integration	Medium	High	Complex integration scenarios


Recommendation:
Use Spring Cloud Stream if you want a simple, event-driven approach.

Use JCSMP if you need advanced Solace features or fine-grained control.
