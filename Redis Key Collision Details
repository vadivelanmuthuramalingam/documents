	Redis cannot guarantee 100% avoidance of key collision unless developer enforce uniqueness in key design. Redis itself doesn‚Äôt magically prevent application from accidentally overwriting a key ‚Äî if application SET with the same key name, it‚Äôll happily replace the old value.

The trick is in how you design your keyspace. Some production-grade ways to minimize (practically eliminate) collisions:

Key Design Strategies

Use namespaces (prefixes)
	Example:
		vca:123:profile
		mvca:2025:status
	
	This makes collisions nearly impossible unless two different services accidentally choose the same naming scheme.

Include business identifiers
	Keys should embed unique attributes of the entity (user ID, order ID, session ID, etc.).
	Example:
		session:{userId}:{uuid}

Add random/UUID suffix for extra safety
	If multiple values can exist for the same entity at the same time:
		transaction:{orderId}:{UUID.randomUUID()}

Leverage Redis hash structures instead of flat keys
	Instead of scattering keys:

	user:123:name
	user:123:email


	You can consolidate into a hash:

	HSET user:123 name "Alice" email "alice@example.com"
	‚Üí This avoids having too many flat keys and reduces the chance of collision.

Enforce TTLs carefully
	If you‚Äôre storing temporary data, expired keys will be reused. Make sure the combination of prefix + identifier is still unique even if old ones vanish.
	
What Redis doesn‚Äôt do
	It does not provide automatic unique key generation for business data.
	It does not warn or error on overwrite (unless you explicitly use SETNX ‚Üí set if not exists).	

üëâ So the balance is:
	Dev responsibility ‚Üí Define a safe key design.
	Automation support ‚Üí 
		Use Spring Data Redis annotations - It required the more changes 
		Choose Service-level prefixes for each domain -	no one ‚Äúforgets‚Äù and accidentally collides keys.
