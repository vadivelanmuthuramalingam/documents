Q&A

Slide 2: Introduction
Complex applications often target multiple platforms (Web, Mobile, Embedded)

Independent frontend teams need autonomy

Multi-frontend design enables scalability and maintainability

Slide 3: What is Multi-Frontend Architecture?
Architecture with multiple independently developed, tested, and deployed frontend apps

Each frontend can serve a unique user group or platform

Frontends share backend APIs and infrastructure

Slide 4: Benefits
Modularity: Decoupled frontend codebases

Parallel Development: Multiple teams can work simultaneously

Independent Deployment

Technology Flexibility (React, Angular, Flutter, etc.)

Scalable & Maintainable

Slide 5: Design Patterns
Micro-Frontends (Each UI module is independently deployable)

Shell + Plugin Architecture

Monolithic UI with Conditional Rendering

Multi-Platform UIs Sharing a Core Layer

Slide 6: Tech Stack
Web: React, Angular, Vue

Mobile: React Native, Flutter

Build & Packaging: Webpack Module Federation, Nx, Single-SPA

API Communication: REST, GraphQL

Authentication: OAuth2, OpenID Connect, SAML

Slide 7: Shared Services
Authentication & Authorization

User Preferences / Settings

Feature Flagging Services

Central Logging & Monitoring (e.g., Kibana)

Notification Services

Slide 8: Security
🔐 Token-Based Authentication (JWT, OAuth2)

🔐 SSO via OpenID Connect / SAML

🔐 Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) management

🔐 HTTPS enforcement

🔐 Content Security Policy (CSP)

🔐 Secure Cookie & Session Management

🔐 Web Application Firewall (WAF)

🔐 Access Control (RBAC / ABAC)

Slide 9: Role of CDN (Content Delivery Network)
🚀 Fast Content Delivery – Distributes static content across global edge locations

📦 Caching – Reduces latency and load on origin servers

🛡️ Security – Helps with DDoS protection, TLS termination, and origin shielding

🔍 Edge Logic – Some CDNs offer edge computing (e.g., Cloudflare Workers) for auth, redirects, etc.

🔐 Geo-blocking / Rate-limiting – Helps enforce regional compliance and throttling

Slide 10: Communication Between Frontends
Event Bus (shared in browser or shell app)

Local/Session Storage

PostMessage API for iframe-based comms

Shared Services / API Gateway

Slide 11: Deployment Strategies
Monorepo or Polyrepo

CI/CD pipelines for each UI

Containerized frontends (Docker + K8s/OpenShift)

Static assets hosted via CDN or Object Storage (e.g., AWS S3 + CloudFront)

Environment-based deployment (Dev, UAT, Prod)

Slide 12: Real-World Example
Banking Platform

Customer Portal: React Web App

Mobile Banking App: Flutter

Admin Dashboard: Angular

Chat Widget on Partner Sites: Web Component

All UIs share:

Auth Services

Config Services

API Gateway

Analytics & Monitoring

Slide 13: Best Practices
Design with loose coupling & shared contracts

Define API and UI versioning strategies

Apply DevSecOps for secure delivery

Use Linting, Tests, Static Code Analysis

Adopt infrastructure monitoring and alerting
