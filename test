Feature	Description
High Availability	RDQM runs on three Linux servers and ensures queue manager availability even if one server fails.
Synchronous Replication	Queue manager data is replicated in real time across the nodes.
Failover Support	If the active node fails, one of the standby nodes takes over automatically.
Disaster Recovery (DR) Option	Supports asynchronous replication to a DR site (optional configuration).
No Shared Storage Required	Uses local disks on each node instead of SAN/NFS.
