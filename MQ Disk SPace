What consumes disk space in MQ
1️⃣ Queue Manager logs (transaction logs):

MQ’s recovery and durability rely on these logs.

Logs grow with persistent messages and transactions.

2️⃣ Queue files (persistent messages):

Each queue holding persistent messages stores them on disk until consumed or expired.

Transient/non-persistent messages don’t stay on disk.

3️⃣ Configuration data (QMGR config, object definitions).

📐 Disk space sizing considerations
1️⃣ Persistent message volume
Estimate peak queue depth × max message size for your busiest queue(s) to calculate potential disk usage for queue data.

Example: If you expect up to 10,000 messages of 10KB → that’s ~100MB.

2️⃣ Transaction logs
Transaction logs are the biggest disk consumers for high-volume apps using persistent messages.

Disk space required depends on:

Number of log files (LogPrimaryFiles + LogSecondaryFiles) × size of each file (LogFilePages × 4KB/page).

Number and duration of active transactions.

🔎 Example:
In qm.ini:

makefile
Copy
Edit
Log:
   LogPrimaryFiles=15
   LogSecondaryFiles=10
   LogFilePages=16384
Each log file: 16384 pages × 4KB = 64MB

Total primary logs: 15 × 64MB = 960MB

Total secondary logs: 10 × 64MB = 640MB

So logs can grow up to ~1.6GB.

3️⃣ Queue manager + configuration overhead
Add ~500MB–1GB for queue manager object definitions and other metadata.

✅ Recommended sizing formula
Minimum disk space ≈

scss
Copy
Edit
(Max persistent messages × avg size)
+ (total primary + secondary logs)
+ (1GB buffer for QMGR config/metadata)
+ (30–50% overhead for growth/spikes)
✅ Example calculation
If:
✅ Expect peak of 200,000 messages at 5KB → 1GB queue data.
✅ Logs: ~2GB (from above example).
✅ Add 1GB for config.
✅ Add 50% overhead → ~2GB extra.

Recommended disk space:
1GB + 2GB + 1GB + 2GB overhead = 6GB minimum
Realistically: allocate 10–20GB for production queue managers.

✅ Additional tips for disk setup
✅ Place MQ data directories (/var/mqm/qmgrs/) and log directories (/var/mqm/log/) on separate disks/partitions if possible → isolates logs from queue data and avoids one filling up the other.
✅ Use fast disks (SSD/NVMe) for transaction logs → MQ’s performance for persistent messages is log-write bound.
✅ Monitor disk usage proactively → set alerts before reaching 80% utilization.
✅ Consider log archiving for older logs (if you enable circular logs, they won’t grow indefinitely; if linear, logs grow until archived).
✅ In cloud environments → ensure your persistent volume supports IOPS/throughput requirements of your workload.

🔎 Commands to check disk usage for MQ
On your MQ server, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
df -h /var/mqm
To check log directory usage:

bash
Copy
Edit
du -sh /var/mqm/log/*
✅ Key MQ config files
qm.ini: defines log settings.

mqs.ini: system-wide config.

MQ data: /var/mqm/qmgrs/<QMGR_NAME>/

MQ logs: /var/mqm/log/<QMGR_NAME>/

🚨 Important!
If disk fills up:

MQ stops accepting new persistent messages.

Queue manager may fail or freeze.

Must free disk space or remove messages to resume operation.

🔥 TL;DR Recommended disk setup
✅ For small/medium workloads → 10–20GB per queue manager
✅ For high-throughput systems → plan 30–100GB or more depending on persistent message retention and expected queue depths.
